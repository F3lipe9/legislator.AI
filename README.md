Project: "Legislator.AI" (MVP with Recommendation Engine)


1. Vision Statement (The Big Picture):
To create more robust and effective legislation by serving as an intelligent, non-partisan co-pilot that helps policymakers identify potential improvements, inconsistencies, and evidence-based enhancements to bills.


2. MVP Goal (The Focused Objective for Version 1):
To build a tool that analyzes an existing bill and provides a focused set of non-partisan, evidence-backed recommendations for amendments, and then allows the user to seamlessly generate a final, consolidated draft incorporating their chosen changes.


3. Target User:
Primary: Legislative Aides, Policy Analysts, and Legal Counsel in governmental offices.
Secondary: Bipartisan working groups and legislative drafters responsible for improving bill quality.


4. Core Value Proposition:
"Don't just draft; improve. LegisLens AI analyzes your bill to proactively identify gaps, inconsistencies, and opportunities to strengthen it with evidence and legal precedent, then helps you instantly create the final version."


5. MVP Feature Set:
Input:
Bill Upload: User uploads or pastes the text of an existing bill.
Processing & Analysis (The Core AI Magic):
Recommendation Engine: The AI analyzes the bill and generates a list of proposed amendments, categorized by type and backed by a clear, non-partisan rationale. For example:
Clarity & Precision: "Recommend defining the term 'renewable energy source' in Section 2. Currently, it is ambiguous and could lead to legal challenges. Rationale: Legal drafting best practices require defining key operational terms."
Internal Consistency: *"The reporting deadline in Section 5(a) is 'within 30 days,' but Section 6(b) references 'the quarterly report.' This is a conflict. Recommendation: Amend Section 6(b) to align with the 30-day requirement."*
External Consistency (Legal): *"This provision may conflict with [Existing Statute ABC-123] which preempts local regulation in this area. Recommendation: Add a clause stating 'To the extent not preempted by [ABC-123]...' Rationale: To avoid immediate legal invalidation."*
Evidence & Precedent: "The mandated technology in Section 4 is not commercially available at scale. Recommendation: Add a feasibility study phase or reference alternative technologies A, B, and C. Rationale: Based on Department of Energy reports X and Y."
Enforceability & Implementation: "Section 7 lacks a designated enforcement agency. Recommendation: Specify which agency is responsible for implementation. Rationale: Without this, the provision may be unenforceable."
User Workflow:
The user reviews the AI-generated list of recommendations.
For each recommendation, they can "Accept," "Reject," or "Modify."
If they Accept, the amendment is queued. If they Modify, they can edit the precise language before queuing it.
Consolidation & Output:
One-Click Final Draft: Once the user has selected their amendments, they click a button to generate a clean, fully consolidated final bill.
Change Log: A comprehensive report detailing all accepted amendments and the AI's original rationale for each.


6. How We Ensure a Non-Partisan Stance (Critical for Trust):
Rationale-Based Recommendations: Every suggestion must be tied to a objective standard:
Legal Consistency (conflict with existing law)
Logical Consistency (internal contradictions)
Drafting Best Practices (clarity, definiteness)
Empirical Evidence (data, feasibility studies)
Administrative Law (enforceability, agency designation)
No Political Language: The AI will never recommend amendments based on ideological outcomes (e.g., "to be more progressive/conservative," "to appeal to a certain demographic"). The focus is on the quality, robustness, and legality of the legislation.
Transparency: The "why" behind every recommendation is visible and auditable.


7. Explicitly Out-of-Scope for MVP:
Cost/Benefit Analysis or Fiscal Scoring. V2.
Predicting Political Support/Opposition. V2.
Stakeholder Impact Analysis (e.g., "This will hurt industry X"). V2.
Full legal sufficiency guarantee. The output remains a powerful drafting aid, not a certified legal product.


8. Key Metrics for Success:
Recommendation Quality: Percentage of AI recommendations that users rate as "useful" or "actionable" (even if not accepted). (Success: >70%).
Adoption Rate: Percentage of users who accept at least one AI recommendation per session.
Time to Robustness: Reduction in time users report spending on identifying hidden flaws and inconsistencies in a draft.
User Trust: Measured through repeat usage and surveys focusing on the tool's perceived objectivity.


9. The Learning Goal:
The primary hypothesis to validate is: "Policymakers will trust and use an AI tool that provides objective, evidence-based recommendations to improve a bill's legal soundness and operational clarity, and this will lead to the creation of higher-quality legislation."
