Legislator.AI — MVP with Recommendation Engine
1. Vision Statement (The Big Picture)

To create more robust and effective legislation by serving as an intelligent, non-partisan co-pilot that helps policymakers identify potential improvements, inconsistencies, and evidence-based enhancements to bills.

Tagline:

“Don’t just draft; improve.”

2. MVP Goal (Version 1 Objective)

Build a tool that analyzes an existing bill and provides a focused set of non-partisan, evidence-backed recommendations for amendments, then allows the user to seamlessly generate a consolidated final draft incorporating their chosen changes.

3. Target User

Primary: Legislative aides, policy analysts, and legal counsel in governmental offices.

Secondary: Bipartisan working groups and legislative drafters responsible for improving bill quality.

4. Core Value Proposition

"LegisLens AI analyzes your bill to proactively identify gaps, inconsistencies, and opportunities to strengthen it with evidence and legal precedent, then helps you instantly create the final version."

5. MVP Feature Set
Input

Bill Upload: Users can upload or paste text of an existing bill.

Processing & Analysis (Core AI Engine)

The AI generates recommendations in five key categories:

Category	Example
Clarity & Precision	“Define ‘renewable energy source’ in Section 2 to avoid ambiguity. Rationale: Legal drafting best practices require defining operational terms.”
Internal Consistency	“Section 5(a) says 30 days; Section 6(b) says quarterly. Amend 6(b) to align with 30-day requirement.”
External Consistency	“Provision may conflict with [Statute ABC-123]. Recommendation: Add ‘To the extent not preempted by ABC-123…’”
Evidence & Precedent	“Technology in Section 4 not commercially available. Recommend feasibility study or alternatives A, B, C. Rationale: DOE reports X & Y.”
Enforceability & Implementation	“Section 7 lacks enforcement agency. Specify agency. Rationale: Without this, provision may be unenforceable.”
User Workflow

Review AI-generated recommendations.

Accept / Reject / Modify each recommendation.

Queue accepted and modified amendments.

Consolidation & Output

One-Click Final Draft: Generates a clean, fully consolidated final bill.

Change Log: Reports all accepted amendments with AI rationale.

6. Ensuring Non-Partisan Output

Rationale-Based Recommendations: Every suggestion is tied to objective standards: legal consistency, internal logic, drafting best practices, empirical evidence, and enforceability.

No Political Language: AI does not suggest amendments based on ideology.

Transparency: Each recommendation includes the “why” behind it for auditability.

8. Key Metrics for Success
Metric	Goal
Recommendation Quality	≥ 70% rated useful/actionable
Adoption Rate	≥ 50% of users accept ≥1 recommendation
Time to Robustness	Measurable reduction in time to identify issues
User Trust	4.0+/5.0 survey rating
Non-Partisan Compliance	100% adherence to objective, evidence-based criteria
9. AI Model & Training Plan
9.1 Curriculum-Based Training Stages

Training proceeds from foundations → reasoning → style → state specialization.

Stage	Data Source	Purpose	Weight
1	U.S. Constitution, Federal statutes	Teach legal principles & boundaries	10%
2	Court cases (Supreme & MA Appeals)	Teach legal reasoning & interpretation	10%
3	Federal bills	Teach structure, phrasing, and enforceability	25%
4	Massachusetts bills	Target state style, structure, and legal references	25%
5	Drafting manuals (MA, optional other states)	Teach formatting & clause style	10%
6	Other states bills (CA, TX, NY, FL)	Increase stylistic & policy diversity	15%
7	Summaries & analyses (GovTrack, CRS, agency reports)	Support evidence-based recommendations	5%
9.2 Data Organization
data/
├── 1_federal_foundations/
├── 2_court_cases/
├── 3_federal_bills/
├── 4_massachusetts_bills/
├── 5_drafting_manuals/
├── 6_other_states/
└── 7_summaries_and_analyses/


Each document includes structured metadata headers (TYPE, STATE, TOPIC, YEAR, etc.).

Example .json format:

{
  "type": "BILL",
  "level": "STATE",
  "state": "Massachusetts",
  "topic": "Environment",
  "status": "Enacted",
  "year": 2022,
  "content": "Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives..."
}


Metadata CSV per folder tracks document source, topic, year, and status for filtering and dataset balancing.

9.3 Weighting and Adapter Strategy

Base Model: Core legal knowledge + general drafting knowledge.

State Adapters: Lightweight fine-tuning modules per state (MA, NY, TX, etc.) that specialize in local law, style, and citations.

During inference, system dynamically loads:

base_model + state_adapter


Later, adapters can be merged into a national/federal model once performance is validated.

9.4 Recommendation Engine Workflow

Segment bill text → sections/subsections.

Classify issues → clarity, internal consistency, enforceability, external consistency, evidence.

Retrieve references → laws, statutes, court cases, summaries.

Generate recommendations → structured output with rationale.

User review → Accept / Reject / Modify.

Consolidate final draft → output with change log.

10. MVP Development Roadmap
Phase	Deliverable	Focus
1	Data pipeline + labeling	Clean and structure MA legal corpus
2	Baseline model fine-tune	Core AI comprehension + recommendation logic
3	Rule-based consistency engine	Detect internal/external conflicts
4	Recommendation prototype	Generate five recommendation types
5	Frontend + change log	User workflow & bill consolidation
6	Feedback loop	Collect user ratings for retraining & model improvement
11. Scaling & Multi-State Expansion

Start with Massachusetts-only → validate MVP & recommendation logic.

Add other states adapters (CA, TX, NY, FL) → multi-state testing.

Integrate federal adapter → allow any bill type.

Merge into national model → universal recommendation engine capable of drafting or improving bills for any U.S. jurisdiction.

12. User Trust & Non-Partisan Guarantees

All recommendations require rationale tied to law, logic, or empirical evidence.

No ideological language or predictions about political outcomes.

Full audit logs track every AI recommendation and user decision.

Modular training ensures each state’s style is respected without bias from other jurisdictions.
