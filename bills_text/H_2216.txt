(b) Whoever engages in conduct that violates any of the provisions of law listed in chapter 265 of the General Laws which results in the death of, or bodily injury to, a child in utero when the conduct occurs, is guilty of a separate offense under this section.
(c) (1) Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the punishment for that separate offense is the same as the punishment provided under the General Laws for that conduct had the injury or death occurred to the unborn child’s mother.
(2) An offense under this section does not require proof that-

the defendant intended to cause the death of, or bodily injury to, the unborn child
(d) Nothing in this section shall be construed to permit the prosecution-

of any person for any medical treatment of the pregnant woman or her unborn child; or
of any woman with respect to her unborn child.
